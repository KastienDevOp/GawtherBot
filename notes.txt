GENERAL NOTES

  - in the createDb.py file, the schema has changed. id's are no longer primary keys as it throws errors with the code








  ================== 10/26/2022 ====================

  1) we need to create a language filter json file, and use it to filter messages on each on_message event, and we need to be sure
     to check along with commands. What I mean is that the bot is already looking for messages each time we send a message no matter
     what, but when we send a command, for example in the create custom embed function, the user depicts what they want their description
     of the embed to be. Those use entries also need to be taken into account with the bots language filter so that when the language
     filter goes to intervine and take the message away for inappropraite language, it can either put the current command on hold until
     the user enters a message that meets the filters requirements, or cancels the current command being executed, otherwise, when the member
     goes to respond to the bot with a message, and the language filter takes and deletes the message before the command can get access to it,
     then the command is going to error out.



  ================== 10/27/2022 ====================

  - Write in DB logic for bank_commands.py line 149
  - Run a triple check debug on all existing commands; fix what's broken
  - create a plan for other commands to incorporate, generate list, split list if want
  - plan a release date for version one
  - plan out advertisement, if any else word of mouth



  ================= 10/28/2022 =====================

  - Kastien, read the commands.json file. At the top, the first key, value pair is for you.
  - added more commands
    - rules command for general.py
    - adjust_balance command for bank.py

  ================= 10/28/2022 =====================

  - Re-wrote purge command to place the function for converting the removed messages into a temp memory file into the API folder
  - Re-writing all commands to incorporate buttons
  - Started a basic API folder for simple api instructions

  ================= 11/09/2022 =====================

  - fixed file paths in bot.py
  - fixed table creation error in members.db
  - fixed table creation error in create_database.py
  - updated helpers.py to incorporate part of purge command, and obtaining restricted channels for on_message_event
  - updated on_member_join.py to have correct file paths, database paths, and writing users to the database
  - foxed task_loops to have correct file paths
  - corrected setup.json to incorporate multiple guilds for our use to start with. Need an on_guild_join cog listener to handle that.
    - I will likely (mek) be the one to write this as I have some ideas on channel setups and such.
  - updated check system in on_message cog listener to ignore webhook messages from github.

  ================= 11/10/2022 =====================

  - commented out task loop for checking the database for members to ensure they're written. Is continuously writing the same members over and over. needs to be fixed.
  - offloaded dev_commands.py because it keeps telling me that the the interaction has already been responded to, and it keeps displaying an error that is no longer there.
