#### Back in 2019, Mek moved to Philadelphia, where her best friend Kas was currently residing, for a fresh start on life. A few days after moving, Mek and Kas were hanging out and Mek saw Kas was programming. A year ago, Mek was attending college for accounting, and was also an avid [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) player. Learning that Minecraft was built using [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/) and she wanted to give it a try. Trying to build her first calculator was one of the more difficult task which lead to her giving up. (If only she had known about [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/)!)

> Python is a very easy to understand and learn language as it's written as if you're having a conversation with one of your friends. A brief difference between the two

```
Java

class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

Python

print("Hello, World!")

```

> Notice here that we did not need a class instantiated to be able to print "Hello, World!" to the console.
