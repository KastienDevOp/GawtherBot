# About Gawther <a name="#about-gawther">ðŸ“Ž</a>

Gawther started back in 2019, originally named ButtlerBot. ButtlerBot was going to be the bot that could do anything every other bot can do and more. From bridging various game chats through different socket workings and https calls, to relaying information back and forth between it's website counter-partner and all of it's inclusions. This bot was going to be the brain behind everything, however, as progression continued, we started noticing how limited the [discord api](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) was eventually ButtlerBot became a stagnant project that is now being converted into Gawther. Gawther's inspiration came from various components of my life. The first component being my immediate surroundings. Starting with my friends. What can discord help me automate for them? Well the major thing being notifications, automated messages for streaming and such, bridged game chats for interactions with discord members who aren't in the game, and a few other things. The second component was what can I create that no one else can. That's the main question every programmer asks themselves. What can I create that can blow the world away?! Well after a while of researching various bots, I noticed that there weren't really a lot of gaming bots. What I mean is bots that actually have games. Not your average Hangman, or CoinFlip, but I'm gearing more towards actual text-based [RPG's](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27052/role-playing-game-rpg). Although there are other contributing components to the creation of Gawther, those are the two main driving points.

# About The Team <a name="#about-team">ðŸ“Ž</a>

The team is currently comprised of only Kas and myself. We have slots available for anyone who'd like to become one of Gawther's Developers, but for now it's just an interview-styled conversation with Kas and me. In the future, I do plan to build a web-based application along with a text-based application through Gawther.

## Mek

With having such a wide-scaled scheme of what I wanted my bot to achieve, I realized I had bit off more than I could chew as I took zero time to study the Python langauge inside and out and just jumped straight into learning a few basics and then running away with the documentation (which I had zero clue on how to read) which explains why there are so many different versions and re-writes to ButtlerBot as I was not only learning the language, but learning how to read documentation as well as doing other side projects (oooh squirrel moments) and could just never sit down and focus long enough to complete a project.  

You can find my very first repository [here](https://github.com/shellbyy0124?tab=repositories) which contains all the projects I have started and never completed (or trashed). If you'd like more direct links, see below. As you digress through the repository, you'll see 1) numerous re-writes of the bot, and the incorporation of other projects as I started to branch out into other languages and projects. As you hover over each link, a hinting window will show up explaining each repo and a description of what the repository is about.

As you can see, my new repository has drastically increased as with my progression into programming, I've learned more proper setups for various projects, better ways to write the same things. I've learned amazing things programmaticaly such as one-line if-statments, one-line for loops with list comprehension, and more. As someone who learned a couple of basics and then decided to take on the world, I ***highly*** recomment to each new programmer to please take the time to learn the basics. Learn the fundamentals over and over until you can do them in your sleep. Start a Learning folder for yourself where you house all of your tutorials and side projects. When you learn a new concept, go practice it or build a project with it.

  - The note must be a printable [string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html).
- **Create Category**
  - /developers create_category
  - As an ever-growing and ever-developing community, this allows the developers to be able to quickly create a new category within the discord. In future updates of the bot, this command will be developed further to allow for *security options* which are different levels of permissions for the various roles within the discord server to have setup autonimously.
  - The category name must be a printable [string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html).
- **Create Channel**
  - /developers create_channel
  - In addition to the **Create Category** command, this command allows developers to swiftly create channels within a category within the discord extension and automatically syncs the channels permissions to that of the parent category. Requests user in put for the channel's name, and category.
  - The channel name and category name must be a printable [string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html).
- **Delete Category**
  - /developers delete_category
  - Allows developers to delete a specified category within the discord server. It requests user input on what to do with any channels that are in the category currently with the options to delete or move them. 
  - User inputs must be a printable [string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html).
- **Delete Channel**
  - /developers delete_channel

# Gawther's Tasks <a name="#task-loops">ðŸ“Ž</a>

Gawther is also comprised of a number of task loops that majorly assist in language filters, bridge chat re-connections, and more.

## On Member Join <a name="#on-member-join">ðŸ“Ž</a>

This function activates when a member joins the discord by sending the user a welcome embed. Within this embed, we display our values, missions, rules, and punishment table. The embed may seem a bit overwhelming as we are currently debating on a proper approach for this welcome message, but it also selects a random quote to display on the welcome embed that is sent to the designated welcome channel within the discord server. In addition, it also writes the new member to the database (or picks back up where the member left off if it's a returning member) with a fresh bank amount of $1,000 GB. The GB stands for Gawther Bucks.

## Check Pending <a name="#pending-verification">ðŸ“Ž</a>

This task loop runs every 24 hours and checks for any members who have created their accounts on the [discord main website](https://discord.com) but never verified their accounts through their email, or for whatever reason. If there are any members with a true pending status will be courtesly notified by the bot that their pending verification. Anyone who does not go and verify their account with 72 hours of receiving the first message, then they will be removed from the discord server as a safety precaution.

## Check Database For Members <a name="#check-db-for-members">ðŸ“Ž</a>

This task loop runs every 12 hours and just runs a double check that any and all members who have joined Gawther within the last 12 hours are written to the database. It's a secondary check for just in case a member joins the channel and send Confirm to the bot when the bot DM's them, but it gives them an error message. The staff members will have a command that will write the new member to the database so that the member does not have to wait until the 12-hour mark for the bot to write them to the database.
