<h1>Welcome To The Gawther Platform Github Repository!</h1>

<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
<h4>
  We are Gawther! A community built by programmers for anyone to enjoy. We offer a diverse range of chat channels, available to all with appropriately selected roles, for their enjoyment.
</h4>

<h2>What Do We Provide?</h2>
<h4>
  We provide a variety of games, bot commands, and profiles to further enhance the members visit. Being able to rob your friends on a 0-1 random.choice() chance, to being able to bid and own your friends! In addition, we have in-depth support that is setup in a Support Threads category to allow you to obtain the best help possible without having to search through a jumbled chat channel for your last question and best answer.
</h4>

<h2>What Are Our Perks</h2>
<h4>
  Given that this is a community driven discord server, the GawtherPerks and Reputations haven't been setup yet as we are patiently awaiting for you guys to tell us what you would like to see as perks and rewards within the community.
