# Gawther's Table For Warnings, Mutes, Kicks, and Bans

### When warning, muting, kicking, or banning, a member, the embed will display the total number of each item they already have once the command has been sent (warning to warning, mute to mute, etc.) has been sent via the #moderation_notifications log channel. Typically, we use a sliding scale when it comes to knowing when to use which command.

Table Of Contents:

- [Warnings](#warnings)
- [Mutes](#mutes)
- [Kicks](#kicks)
- [Bans](#bans)

- # Warnings
  - Typically say within 5-10 warnings depending on the severity of the action. Typical things like slurs, mistaken comments, and other minor minor things like that would result in a warning. In other words, if it feels like you would want to give someone a heads up, then pass them a warning.

- # Mutes
  - This command is typically meant for those in the voice channels. It started out as a way to mute the member without having to do all the clicking, however, this command grew to become an actual *Muted* role within the discord server, along with Kicked and Banned. Given that these were migrated into roles, we decided to make it to where the 3 roles (Muted, Kicked, Banned) were unable to see any channels except for the ones pertaining to them being able to appeal our decisions as staff members. Mutes typically range between 5-7 before becoming Kicks for the member.

- # Kicks
  - Kicking a member doesn't necessarily have a need to *actually* remove them from the server. In accordance with the [mute](#mutes) command, this command offers a way to get the users attention without having to physically remove them from the discord. Working on a countdown timer that you put in (the time is in seconds), it will give the member back their original roles to allow them to continue where they left off. They will not have access to any commands except for the appeal command. Once an appeal has been sent, we will be notified (Owners and Head Admins) and will address it from there.

- # Bans
  - Bans are the last resort method for moderating a member. This will remove all of their access to the discord, and delete their information from the database but there's one trick in place. Instead of the bot removing them from the guild, they're placed in a Banned role which is like the Kicked and Muted rule except that the user cannot appeal this decision. When their time is up, the member will be given the basic *Member* role and their information in the database will be reset. We heavily encourage to not have to use this command. If you cannot find a different, better, or more efficient way to moderate the member, then reach out to the other staff members in the #staff_chat channel.
